This is a burp extension having as goal to generate the Burp scanner report.

The extension will start a web server on a specific port and the report
will be available on a specific url.


Parameters to customize the execution:
- scanner.report.port = the port on which the (extension) web server will listen. If no port is specified
  then a port will be computed automatically. The computed port will be MAX(ports of proxy listenets) + 1.

- scanner.report.url = the url on which the report is accessible. If no url is specified then
  the default url will be used ("/scanner/report").

Usage example:
java -jar -Xmx2g -Dscanner.report.port=8085 -Dscanner.report.url=/abc burpsuite_pro_v1.6.39.jar
Starts the web server extension on port 8085 under the url "/abc"

Parameters to customize the output:
-output=XML - the output will be in XML
-output=HTML - the output will be in HTML
-no output parameter then the HTML report will be generated

Requirements to run the extension:
- Java 8 or later
- Burp Suite Professional version 1.6.39 (or later ?) - not sure that the next API
  versions will be backward compatible.
